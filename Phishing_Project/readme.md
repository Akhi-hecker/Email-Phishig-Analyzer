Okay, here's a concise README file focused on requirements, installation, and how to run your Phishing Analyzer project.

```markdown
# Phishing Email Analyzer

A web-based tool to analyze `.eml` email files for potential phishing indicators. Upload an email, and the tool will provide a risk score and a detailed report based on header, sender, URL, and attachment analysis.

## Project Structure

Your project should be organized as follows for the instructions below to work correctly:

```

├── analyzer\_engine.py         \# Core email analysis orchestration
├── settings.py                \# Configuration, API keys, scoring logic
├── requirements.txt           \# Python dependencies
├── analyzers/                 \# Package for specialized analysis modules
│   ├── **init**.py

## Requirements

### 1. Python
* Python 3.7 or newer is recommended.

### 2. Dependencies
Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root of your project directory with the following content:

```text
Flask>=2.0
requests>=2.25
beautifulsoup4>=4.9
lxml
cchardet
````

These libraries are necessary for the web framework, making HTTP requests (for API calls and URL expansion), and parsing HTML content.

### 3\. API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

For full functionality, especially IP reputation and attachment analysis, you'll need API keys from:

  * **AbuseIPDB:** For checking IP address reputation.
      * Sign up at [https://www.abuseipdb.com/](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
  * **VirusTotal:** For checking attachment hashes.
      * Sign up at [https://www.virustotal.com/](https://www.virustotal.com/)

Once you have these keys, you need to add them to the `settings.py` file in your project root:

```python
# settings.py

# ... other settings ...

# --- API Keys (Replace with your actual keys) ---
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY"  # Replace with your AbuseIPDB API Key
VT_API_KEY = "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"        # Replace with your VirusTotal API Key

# ... other settings ...
```

If you don't provide these keys, the application will still run, but the features relying on them will be skipped or provide limited information.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Download or Clone Code:**
    Ensure all the project files (`app.py`, `analyzer_engine.py`, `settings.py`, the `analyzers` directory, `templates` directory, and `requirements.txt`) are in a single project folder.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and run:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

      * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    Open the `settings.py` file in your project's root directory. Find the following lines and replace the placeholder text with your actual API keys:

    ```python
    ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY"
    VT_API_KEY = "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"
    ```

    Save the `settings.py` file. Also, review other settings in this file (scoring weights, thresholds, keyword lists) and adjust them if needed, though the defaults provided in previous steps should offer a good starting point.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and make sure you are in the root directory of your project (the one containing `app.py`) and that your virtual environment is activated.

2.  **Start the Flask Web Server:**
    Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the server is running, you will see output similar to this (the address and port might vary slightly but usually defaults to 5000):

    ```
     * Running on [https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

    Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and go to the address shown, typically:
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

4.  **Using the Analyzer:**

      * You should now see the email upload page.
      * Click "Choose File" to select a `.eml` file you want to analyze.
      * Click "Analyze Email".
      * The results of the analysis will be displayed on a new page.
      * From the results page, you can download a text report or go back to analyze another email.

To stop the Flask application, go back to your terminal and press `CTRL+C`.
